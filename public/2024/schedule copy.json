This talk is mostly not about the Holocaust. It's about red-haired Medieval Jews, and scratches on slates in Cologne, and quite possibly about toilets. It's about how towns are built, about very long histories, and how expulsion is not always what it seems. Gillian's story about building bridges in York was shortlisted for the Sidewise awards and is discussed in TVTropes, and this talk may address why she didn't write the story from the point of view of a Jewish character... but only if the audience is interested.",

    "desc": "So often in historical fantasy, we are bombarded with violence we didn't ask for, particularly sexual violence against women. When this concern is raised, the authors frequently hide behind \"I want to stay true to the time period\" and \"we can't judge the past by today's standards\". But why are authors bound to a period that didn't exist when they're creating a new society? Why do they hold to this, instead of creating their own? And why does the adherence to the past only seem to show up in violence against women and not to the beauty standards of the time? Why is assault more palatable to an audience than unshaved armpits? How do we go about demanding that this change, or do we have to abandon a genre we otherwise love?",
