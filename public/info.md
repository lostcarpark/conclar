# Printable Programme

To minimise waste paper generated by the convention, we encourage all members to
use this electronic programme guide as the primary source of programme
information.

You may download and print this [printable programme grid in PDF format](Glasgow2024GridSchedule.pdf) if you need to.

Printed copies are also available from the info desk at the convention.
