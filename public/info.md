## Programme Notes
If you've been to Octocon before, you may be used to programme items starting on the hour, every hour, and lasting 50 minutes. Octocon has a different schedule nowadays. Most items will last an hour with a half-hour break in between, so take care to note the start times!

# About ConClár
ConClár is an online programme guide tool for conventions.
It has been developed in ReactJS and is intended to work in all modern browsers. It is designed to work equally well on mobile and desktop devices. No application needs to be downloaded and installed as it works in a browser. It does need a network connection to work.

## Tips for Using ConClár

* See more information about each programme item by clicking/tapping the item title or the down arrow to the right.
* Use the checkboxes on the **Programme** page to select the items you want to appear in your personalised programme on the **My Schedule** page. (Note that this can't be copied at the moment to a different device.)
* Use filters to search for topics or types of items. You can use multiple filters at the same time.
* If you want to only see in-person or online items, select from the **Track** filter:
	* At Croke Park: select *Hybrid* and *In-person*
	* Online: select *Hybrid* and *Online*
* You can show the programme in your own timezone by changing your **Settings**. By default, the programme is displayed in Irish time (UTC+1 during the convention) and your browser's default timezone (if it differs from convention time).
